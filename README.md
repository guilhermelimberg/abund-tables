# abund-tables
This script takes smhr or LESSPayne abundance tables and put them into a more comprehensible format.

This repository contains the script and, as an example, high-res. abundance data from the S5 paper ([Ji+2020]([url](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..181J/abstract))), which is in smhr/LESSPayne format, and put it into what I refer as the 'master' abundance table.
